          Hi, I'm <b>Ben Klein</b>, a <b>Ruby on Rails</b> developer  My most recent work has been with
          <a href='http://www.shadowhealth.com/'>ShadowHealth</a> an
          innovative company producing a 3D virtual patient for Medical Education.  I'm interested in developing
          robust web applications using Ruby on Rails, with a focus on backend areas. I'm always interested in
          learning different technologies and languages, as I truly believe different tools exist for different jobs.
          In my spare time, I'm currently learning Node.js and Haskell to expand my perspectives, and also enjoy
          tinkering with Arduino projects. I've been programming for many years, starting with Basic many years ago,
          and progressing through C/C++ (mostly in the Win32 environment), PIC microcontrollers, and most recently Ruby.

                running on Rails 3.2 and I like to use it to try out new techniques and technologies.

          <p>
            I helped develop a Ruby on Rails web app for Nursing Education, which integrated
            with a 3D virtual patient implemented in Unity3D and took the product
            from an opinionated app with two Course types and fixed content, to a
            dynamic system where instructional content and functionality are
            separated.  When I started, instructional content was contained in
            hashes in the codebase, with copyedits from nurses going through
            development and the usual version control and deployment workflow;
            creating a new course type required a lot of development work, and
            close integration between development and content teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to expand the app, I helped design and implement a system where courses
            acted as containers. The current instructional features of the app were moved
            into various models sharing a common interface, allowing content creators to
            work independently of development. To allow for archiving and the exchange of
            course content between instances, I implemented a JSON export library which I
            was able to detach as a Gem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I laid a development roadmap for implementing version control of
            content, and for separating creation and consumption of content into separate
            apps. Currently, some content is already separated and versioned in such a
            system. App response time also improved and became more consistent in this time
            period, even though our use of caching is almost nonexistent compared to the
            earlier versions of the app.

            I supported the Bid Express website and supporting Windows
            client/server software, assisting customers with a wide range of
            technical competency and issues. The service acts as an easy-to-use
            wrapper around the GPG encryption system, allowing secure encrypted
            bidding on DOT projects (used or mandated by most DOTs in the US).  I
            researched common issues and authored a Training Guide targeting our
            major platforms (Windows XP, Vista, 7).
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, I researched an issue with the PGP key creation GUI and proposed
            a solution to the development team which was implemented largely from my design.
            Additionally, I streamlined weekly pre-release testing by using Ruby and ERB to
            automatically generate configuration files and projects, essentially allowing us
            to build a testing environment with one command. In support of a major version
            release, I travelled personally to several FDOT offices to train and assist with
            opening of bids in the revised system. In the process of transitioning DOTs to
            the new system and on-boarding new agencies, I also converted forms into a
            proprietary configuration format and debugged issues encountered in test-runs.

            I love teaching and helping others grow, and had considered a career as a school teacher. While preschool wasn't the
            right fit for me in the end, I enjoyed the opportunity to learn and grow. I still enjoy teaching and sharing knowledge
            in the technical domains.
